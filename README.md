# tx-data-api

An API for storing and retrieving banking transactions on AWS (single user)

This is mainly for educational purposes for me to familiarise myself with the AWS services below.

## Dependencies

AWS services used:

- Amazon S3 Bucket
- AWs Lambda
- Amazon DynamoDB

Note: Keys are not required at this point as the S3 Bucket is using Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3).
