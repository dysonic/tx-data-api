# tx-data-api

An API for storing and retrieving banking transactions on AWS (single user).
Transactions can be categorized and monthly spending calculated.

This is mainly for educational purposes for me to familiarise myself with the AWS services below.

## Dependencies

Main AWS services used:

* AWS API Gateway
* Amazon S3 Bucket
* AWS Lambda
* Amazon RDS (PostreSQL)

Note: Keys are not required at this point as the S3 Bucket is using Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3).

# Getting started

Hmmm. I haven't got the AWS CloudFormation templates working yet. WIP.
